## Introduction
This app is a project I built along the way during Paul Hudson’s 100DaysOfSwiftUI course.

## Overview
“Guess The Flag” is a game for the user to pick one of the three flags in the options according to the prompt above. If the user guesses correctly, they will earn a point, which adds to their overall score. 
This application aim to improve people knowledge of world flags in an engaging and interactive way.

## Skills Learned
Learned the basics of SwiftUI, for example:
* VStack, HStack and ZStack
* Buttons and images
* Displaying alert messages

## Reflection
Since this was my very first application, creating it was a fantastic experience for me, which encouraged me to further explore the world of Swift.
